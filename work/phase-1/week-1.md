# Phase 1 Work
## Week-1 Summary

- Fix a schedule for writing reports. I decided to write a work report every week (mostly on Wednesday) explaning the work I did over the week. 

- Setup the project-tracker. I created a project tracker, [heming6666/summer2020](https://github.com/heming6666/summer2020), where I will be storing the work reports and everything related to the Summer 2020 project.

- Setup the communication medium with the community and mentors. We will be discussing about the progress of this project every week at the [Slack](hypertrons.slack.com).
